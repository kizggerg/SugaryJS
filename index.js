        Welcome to SugaryJS!

        SugaryJS is currently under development.
        Many of the stubs required for a working prototype can be found in ./src.
        We are hoping to have a working product with samples and documentation by December 3, 2018.
        Until then, feel free to read our proposal, background, and proof-of-concept documentations found in the README.md

        Best Wishes! - The SugaryJS Team
